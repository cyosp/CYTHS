### Description

CYTHS is a sensor which is able to send through 433 MHz transmitter a temperature thus a humidity value.

These information are coded on 32 bits and transmitted using the RSL protocol each 5 minutes.

Sensor is low energy consumption allowing to have it working around 1000 days (~2.8 years) with three 1.5V batteries.

Each sensor has an identifier initialized at the first power on which can be changed if power is unplugged and plugged 3 times in a dedicated time frame.

### Lifetime

Sensor lifetime is calculated using [Oregon Embedded](http://oregonembedded.com/batterycalc.htm) web site and the following information:

| Description                                     | Value |
|:------------------------------------------------|:------|
| Capacity rating of battery (mAh)                | 1250  |
| Current consumption of device during sleep (mA) | 0.02  |
| Current consumption of device during wake (mA)  | 15    |
| Number of wakeups per hour                      | 11    |
| Duration of wake time (ms)                      | 500   |

Estimated battery life is: **1032.29 days, or 2.83 years**.

### Hardware

Sensor is driven by an AVR ATtiny85 microcontroller which is programmed using:
 * The [Tiny AVR Programmer](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11801)
 * [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.org/)

Printed Circuit Board (PCB) has been designed using:
 * [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org)

#### PCB

Sensor is composed of a double layer PCB:

### Code structure

RSL code is based on 32 bits.

They are organized like this:

| 32-31                     | 30-29                          | 28-25                                 | 24-1                      |
|:--------------------------|:-------------------------------|:--------------------------------------|:--------------------------|
| Remote command identifier | Remote command switch position | Switch state to enable (on/off/onoff) | Remote command identifier |

The 4 bits from 25 to 28 never takes value *1111* thus [CYTHS](https://github.com/cyosp/CYTHS) code is organized like this:

| 32-31         | 30-29            | 28-25 | 24-18     | 17-11    | 10-1        |
|:--------------|:-----------------|:------|:----------|:---------|:------------|
| Battery level | Protocol version | 1111  | Sensor id | Humidity | Temperature |

Where:
 * Battery level
 	* 00 <=> 4.86V
 	* 11 <=> 4.35V

 * Protocol version
 	* 00 <=> First protocol managed and implemented
	It's the one described here

 * 1111
	* Fixed value in order to detect a RSL sensor code

 * Sensor id
	* The sensor identifier
	Value between 1 and 127

 * Humidity
	* Value between 0 and 100
    It matches with the real humidity in %

 * Temperature
	* Value between 0 and 1024
	Real temperature is computed like this:
			T=(Ts-400)/10
    With:
		* T: Real temperature in 째C
		* Ts: Temperature coming from sensor
			It means value betwenn 0 and 1024

	At the end it produces the following matching:

		* 0 <=> -40.0 째C
		* ...
		* 40 <=> 0.0 째C
		* ...
		* 1024 <=> 62.4 째C

### Arduino

#### Configuration

These steps will configure Arduino software in order to use the microcontroller running at 16 Mhz:
 * File -> Preferences
  * In *Additional Boards Manager URLs:*
  * Enter *https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damellis/attiny/ide-1.6.x-boards-manager/package_damellis_attiny_index.json*
  * And *OK* button
 * Tools -> Board-> Boards Manager...
    * Search in the list and select: **attiny** by **David A. Mellis**
    * Click *Install*
    * And *Close* button
 * Tools -> Board-> ATtiny25/45/85
 * Tools -> Processor-> ATtiny85
 * Tools -> Clock-> Internal 16 MHz
 * Tools -> Programmer-> USBtinyISP

Then it's necessary to burn fuses of the microcontroller to set this configuration.
Steps are:
 * Plug a microcontroller on the [Tiny AVR Programmer](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11801)
 * Plug the [Tiny AVR Programmer](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11801) to the computer
 * Tools -> Burn Bootloader
