 * A hardware part connected to a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/) in order to:
    * Receive sensors information
    * Drive RSL switch connected to electric heaters


 * A software part hosted by the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/) which:
    * Drives RSL switches
